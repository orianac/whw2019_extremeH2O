## The Problem
Climate change is expected to cause an increase in the frequency and severity of many extreme events. Here, we use a large dataset of deterministic streamflow projections under a variety of scenarios to explore the effects of climate change on droughts and floods at several locations along the Columbia River.

## Application Example
This work can be used to identify areas with higher likelihoods of extreme events. This will allow water managers to plan for future changes using these tools at a fine-scale for each location.

## Sample Data
Our data comes from the Computational Hydrology group at UW. We accessed it by pulling it from Hydroshare. The total files are approximately 20GB but we worked with only a few locations to develop tools that could be scaled up to the larger dataset.

## Specific Questions
What areas are most at risk to long-lasting low-flow scenarios under each of these models?
What times of the year have the greatest variation in predictions, such that managers are operating under a very uncertain framework for floods?

## Existing Methods
Currently, managers are still developing tools to address questions under future climate scenarios. Previous studies have investigated these questions but we hope to expand the analyses to a large ensemble of scenarios and many locations.

## Proposed Methods / Tools
We are using Jupyter Notebooks to analyze the data and plot it to visualize our findings. We used Hydroshare to share the large dataset with all collaborators. We developed a collective codebase using version control and GitHub in order to save the analysis scripts that we plan to apply to the larger dataset in the future.
